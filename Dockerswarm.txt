Docker swarm

1) launch 3 ubuntu machines
2) name one as docker manager and other 2 as node1 and node2
sudo su
3) apt update -y  (in node and manager)
4) apt install docker.io (in node and manager)
5) docker swarm init --advertise-addr <<private ip of your dockerswarm manager>>
(only in manager)
6) running the 5(above) sno will give you some command ...copy that and paste it in 
your nodes
7) now you might get an error that it is not able to establish the connection
because in the security group you have not enabled the port...so check the port and 
enable it in security group
8) now run the command which you get in sno 5 again in the nodes
9) after you will run it you will see that it is connected properly
10) docker service create --name mysvc --replicas 6 -p 8006:8080 tomcat  (run in swarm machine)
(this will launch 6 replicas of tomcat server where it will equally distribute into master and nodes)
11) if you go to swarm manager machine and write docker images you will see tomcat image

12) docker ps (you will see 2 running container...check for nodes as well)
13) docker service ls (you will see the list of the service) (run in swarm manager)
